August Guang, 6th-year PhD Student in Applied Mathematics and Computational Biology at Brown. I study uncertainty in phylogenetic workflows with an application to HIV transmission inference. Currently looking for research positions in industry or academia.

I also do community organizing, previously as the Queer Justice Coordinator and more recently as a Healing Process Coordinator with the [Providence Youth Student Movement](http://prysm.us), a youth-led organization dedicated to ending state, street, and interpersonal violence within the Southeast Asian community in Providence.
