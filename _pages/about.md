August Guang, Genomics Data Scientist @ [Brown University's Computational Biology Core](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/computational-biology-of-human-disease/) and Healing Coordinator @ [Providence Youth Student Movement](http://prysm.us).

I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics and Computational Biology from Brown University in 2017. My primary research interest is in quantifying uncertainty; my dissertation was on uncertainty in phylogenetic workflows with an application to HIV transmission inference. In a way, that is also my motivation and mantra in community organizing: becoming comfortable with uncertainty and always pushing for change.
